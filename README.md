# 🚀 **Load Testing with Locust, InfluxDB, and Grafana**

## 📌 **Overview**

This project integrates **Locust** 🐍 for load testing, **InfluxDB** 📊 for metric collection, and **Grafana** 📈 for real-time visualization. The goal is to simulate high-traffic scenarios, monitor system performance, and analyze results efficiently. The entire environment is orchestrated with **Docker Compose** for easy deployment and execution.

## ✅ **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed before running the project:

- 🐳 **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)** and **Docker Compose**
- 🐍 **[Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)** (for manual testing if needed)

## ⚙️ **Installation and Configuration**

1️⃣ Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/omaciasd/load-testing-locust.git
   cd load-testing-locust
   ```

2️⃣ Copy the environment variables template:

   ```sh
   cp config/.env.example config/.env
   ```

   Then edit `config/.env` to customize settings.

3️⃣ Build and start the services:

   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

## 🛠️ **How to Use the Project**

### 🏁 **1️⃣ Access the Locust UI**

Open your browser and go to:
   👉 [http://localhost:8089](http://localhost:8089)
Here, you can define the number of users and the ramp-up rate to start the test.

### 📊 **2️⃣ Monitor Metrics in Grafana**

Access Grafana at:
   👉 [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

A preconfigured dashboard for Locust metrics is available. Navigate to **Dashboards → Load Testing Overview** to analyze key metrics such as:

- Requests per second (RPS)
- Response times
- Error rates
- Active users

### 🎯 **3️⃣ Controlled Test Execution**

Locust is designed to be launched from the **UI only**, ensuring a controlled environment for the client.

---

## 🔍 **Verify Data in InfluxDB**

To check if Locust is sending data to InfluxDB, run:

   ```sh
   docker exec -it influxdb influx query --org my-org 'from(bucket:"locust_metrics") |> range(start: -5m)'
   ```

You should see response times and HTTP status codes.

---

## 🛑 **Stop and Clean Up the Environment**

To stop services:

   ```sh
   docker-compose down
   ```

To remove all stored volumes and data:

   ```sh
   docker-compose down -v
   ```
